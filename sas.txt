it takes time to heal and forgive, and I think I was on that path before I was accused of cheating. And in my opinion it felt absurd to be judged based on your past actions. 

When I sent that picture, I was looking for my wife's support and empathy and then the other stuff could have brought up later. That's why I sent the pix in the first place. I felt left out to hang dry. 

When you were in China, keke and i went to dinner and during dinner conversation she talked about how some kids or kid pix on her and calls her racial names and she literally teared up. It's also why she hated high school. I felt bad that as parent nothing I could do, but I comforted her and told .......and had same experiences

I know you are not racist but I wanted that support from you and i didn't get it. 
i want my girls to look back and say dad wasn't perfect but the he was always there for us and mom despite what she did to him.
